Fritzing Components and How to Use Them
==================================================

All Fritzing components you need during the development of the Fritzing schematic are combined in the attached Fritzing collection.

You might find it confusing that some of the core components are in there as well. We decided to reproduce them for them being too huge compared to our other schematic symbols.
If you don't understand this, you are free to use the former core parts.

If you would like to create your own Fritzing parts, you can use the attached SVGs.
