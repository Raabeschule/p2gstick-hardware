Comment on Fritzing Components and How to Use Them
==================================================

All Fritzing components you need during the development of the Fritzing schematic are combined in the attached Fritzing collection.

You might find it confusing that some of the core components are in there as well. We decided to reproduce them for them being too huge for the other schematic symbols of us.
If you don't understand this, you are free to use the former core parts.

If you like to create your own Fritzing parts, you can orientate on the SVGs attached.
