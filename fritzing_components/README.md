Comment on Fritzing Components and How to use Them
==================================================

All Fritzing components you need during the development of the Fritzing schematic are combined in the attached Fritzing schematic.

You might find it confusing that some of the core components are in there as well. We decided to reproduce them for them being too tiny for the other schematic svmbols of us.
If you don't understand this, you'll be free to use the former core parts.

If you like to create your own Fritzing parts, you can orientate on the SVGs attached.
